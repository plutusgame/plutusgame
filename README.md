Lottery ADA Game (LAG) is a Plutus Smart Contract that enable users to play by sending 1 ADA.  Any user can play as many times as he/she wants to increase the probabilities to be selected. 

This contract is based on pure randomness which means that the random player will be the winner at every cycle.  

Each cycle will last 2.5 days or 2 winners in 1 epoch, but this is a something that can be set at any interval. After each cycle a winner will be selected and the funds will be sent directly to the user wallets and the cycle will start again for the next day.
